I would like to express my very great appreciation to my
supervisor Stehpen Gould for his valuable and constructive
suggestions during the planning and development of this
research work. His great patience and willingness to give
his time so generously has been very much appreciated.

I would also like to express my very great appreciation to the
open source community (Python, OpenCV and Chun-Nam Yu etc.). I
cannot finish this work without their generous contributions.
