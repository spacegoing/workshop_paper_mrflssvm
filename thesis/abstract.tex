The lower linear envelope potentials, one of higher-order
potentials used in Markov Random Fields (MRFs) are raising
interests in recent years due to its capability of enforcing
consistency over large sets of random variables. Previous
researches in this area are only able to learn the lower linear
envelope function approximately thus losses a rich class of
representations which may harm the model's performance.

In this thesis we propose an exact formulation of the lower
linear envelope function which can also be inferred exactly and
learned using the latent structural SVM. We first show the
implicit equivalence between the quadratic pseudo-Boolean
formulation and linear combination formulation of the lower
linear envelope. Then, with the exact inference developed by
previous research~\cite{gouldlearning}, we propose the learning
algorithm based on the linear combination formulation within a
latent structural SVM framework.

We experiment our algorithm on two experiments and demonstrate
advantages and disadvantages between our new formulation and
previous formulation~\cite{gouldlearning,Gould:ICML2011}. The
results show that despite computational expensive during
training, our new method is more efficient during testing, able
to learn the lower linear envelope exactly and performs better on
harder problems than the previous method.
